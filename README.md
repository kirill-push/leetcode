# LeetCode Solutions

Inside this repository, you will find my solutions to a variety of LeetCode coding challenges. I regularly update it as I solve more problems and improve my coding skills.
These solutions are organized by problem main topic, and there is a dedicated folder containing test cases for these solutions. Some problems are solved according to a structured learning plan, while others are selected in free mode. 

By clicking on the problem's title, you'll be directed to the corresponding LeetCode problem page. Clicking on "**link to solution**" will take you to my solution stored in this repository. 

Your feedback is highly appreciated!
Enjoy your coding journey! :rocket:
